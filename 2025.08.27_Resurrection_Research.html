            <strong>🎬 No Cinematographer Announced</strong>
            After exhaustive research: NO cinematographer has been announced, and there are NO credible rumors or
            speculation in the industry press.
        </div>

        <h2>Production Timeline Clarification</h2>
        <div class="production-status">
            <h3>CURRENT STATUS: Advanced Development Phase</h3>
            <p><strong>The film is NOT in formal pre-production.</strong> Despite press releases suggesting imminent
                filming, the absence of key department heads (especially cinematographer and VFX supervisor) indicates
                the project remains in advanced development.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Indicators:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>No cinematographer = no shot list, no visual planning</li>
                <li>No VFX supervisor = no de-aging tests for Caviezel</li>
                <li>No official budget in SEC filings = no formal greenlight</li>
                <li>Conflicting start dates = schedule not locked</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>When Pre-Production Actually Begins:</strong> The hiring of a cinematographer will be the
                definitive signal that formal pre-production has commenced. This will be announced in the trades
                immediately.</p>

                Possibilities: What is and is not known</span>
        </h3>

        <p>More than two decades after <em>The Passion of the Christ</em> became a global cinematic event, Mel Gibson's
            highly anticipated sequel, <em>The Resurrection of the Christ</em>, continues to generate media attention
            and speculation. While official studio partnerships and release dates <em>project an image</em> of powerful
            forward momentum, a clinical investigation into the production's real-world footprint tells a more nuanced
            story. This report synthesizes all publicly available information to clearly distinguish between confirmed
            facts, contradictory timelines, and the critical, unconfirmed details—notably the absence of a
            cinematographer—that strongly indicate the project remains in an advanced development phase,
            <strong>NOT</strong> formal pre-production. The scope of this research is exhaustive, regarding
            <strong>public media and official statements</strong>, but does not include analysis of non-public industry
            databases or direct sourcing from the production entities.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #f1f5f9; margin-top: 30px;">I. Confirmed Information</h3>

        <p>Amid the swirl of speculation, a solid foundation of confirmed facts provides the bedrock for the project.
            From the powerful studio partnership to the return of its core cast, these are the details that have been
            officially announced and cemented in the public record.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Studio Partnership & Distribution:</strong> <strong>Lionsgate</strong> has officially partnered
                with Mel Gibson's <strong>Icon Productions</strong> to produce and distribute the film worldwide. This
                was confirmed in multiple statements by Lionsgate Motion Picture Group Chair Adam Fogelson [1].</li>
            <li><strong>Core Creative & Production Team:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Director:</strong> Mel Gibson [1].</li>
                    <li><strong>Writers:</strong> Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace have been attached since the project's
                        early stages. Donal Gibson's involvement was later confirmed [2].</li>
                    <li><strong>Producers:</strong> Mel Gibson and Bruce Davey for Icon Productions [1].</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Key Cast:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Jim Caviezel</strong> as Jesus Christ (Confirmed by Caviezel and Gibson in numerous
                        interviews) [3].</li>
                    <li><strong>Maia Morgenstern</strong> as Mary [2].</li>
                    <li><strong>Francesco De Vito</strong> as Peter [2].</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Key Crew:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Production Designer:</strong> Francesco Frigeri is officially attached to the project
                        [4].</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Release Strategy:</strong> The film will be a <strong>two-part release</strong>. Part One is
                scheduled for <strong>Good Friday, March 26, 2027</strong>, and Part Two is scheduled for
                <strong>Ascension Day, May 6, 2027</strong> [1].
            </li>
            <li><strong>Core Technical Requirement:</strong> The use of <strong>digital de-aging technology</strong> for
                actor Jim Caviezel has been explicitly confirmed by Mel Gibson in an interview with pastor Greg Laurie
                [5].</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: #f1f5f9; margin-top: 30px;">II. Partially Confirmed or Contradictory Information</h3>

        <p>Beyond the official press releases, the narrative becomes more complex. Here, we delve into the gray areas:
            the conflicting timelines from credible sources, the publicly discussed but unconfirmed roles, and the
            ambitious creative vision that continues to evolve. These are the points where the promotional narrative and
            operational reality begin to diverge.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Production Timeline & Start Date:</strong> There are conflicting reports regarding the start of
                principal photography.
                <ul>
                    <li>An <strong>August 2025</strong> start date was cited by Manuela Cacciamani, CEO of Rome's
                        Cinecittà Studios, in a direct interview with the Italian financial newspaper <em>Il Sole 24
                            Ore</em> [6].</li>
                    <li>Mel Gibson, in an interview on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in early 2025, stated his
                        hope to begin filming "next year," implying a <strong>2026</strong> start date [7].</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> The 2026 timeline is more operationally consistent with the announced
                        2027 release dates and the current lack of key department heads. The 2025 date is assessed as a
                        promotional or aspirational target set by the studio facility.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Script & Narrative Scope:</strong> Mel Gibson has described the script's content in interviews
                as a non-linear, metaphysical exploration.
                <ul>
                    <li>In his interview with Greg Laurie, Gibson described the film as exploring Christ's descent into
                        Hell and events in "other realms" [5].</li>
                    <li>The reference to the film as an "acid trip" was reported by <em>World of Reel</em> and other
                        outlets, attributed to Gibson's descriptions of the surreal and non-linear nature of the
                        narrative [2].</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> While the creative direction is known, the status of a final, locked
                        shooting script is unconfirmed, with reports of at least six drafts being written over several
                        years.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Composer:</strong> <strong>John Debney</strong>, who scored <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>,
                has stated in interviews, including one with <em>Film Music Magazine</em>, that he has discussed the
                project with Gibson and expects to be involved [8]. However, there has been no formal announcement from
                Lionsgate or Icon Productions confirming his attachment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: #f1f5f9; margin-top: 30px;">III. Unconfirmed Information & Reasoned Speculation</h3>

        <p>The most telling clues about a film's true status are often found in the silences—the roles not yet cast and
            the partnerships not yet forged. This section examines the critical missing pieces of the
            <em>Resurrection</em> puzzle. The absence of these key personnel is the primary indicator that the project,
            while active, has not yet crossed the threshold into formal pre-production.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cinematographer (Director of Photography):</strong> <strong>There is no announced
                    cinematographer.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Importance of the Role:</strong> For a director as visually driven as Mel Gibson, the
                        cinematographer is arguably the most crucial creative collaborator. Gibson's films are defined
                        by their powerful, often brutal, visual language, and his choice of DP fundamentally shapes the
                        film's tone and impact. The announcement of a cinematographer will be the single most important
                        milestone signaling the project's move into formal pre-production.</li>
                    <li><strong>How We Will Know:</strong> This announcement will be a major industry news item,
                        distributed as an official press release from Lionsgate and reported by top-tier trades
                        (<em>Variety</em>, <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, <em>Deadline</em>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Status of Rumors and Speculation:</strong> After an exhaustive search of industry
                        publications, specialized film forums (including Reddit), and social media, it can be stated
                        definitively that there are <strong>no credible, sourced rumors or even significant speculative
                            discussions</strong> linking <em>any</em> specific cinematographer to <em>The Resurrection
                            of the Christ</em>. The conversation around this role is notably silent, which is unusual
                        for a project of this scale and underscores either an exceptionally high level of secrecy or,
                        more likely, that the selection process has not yet begun in earnest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reasoned Speculation on Candidates:</strong> In the absence of rumors, speculation must
                        be based on Gibson's history of collaboration and the specific visual demands of this project.
                        Several logical candidates emerge:
                        <ul style="margin-top: 15px;">
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>The Legacy Choice - Caleb Deschanel:</strong>
                                Deschanel was the cinematographer for the original <em><strong>The Passion of the
                                        Christ</strong></em>, for which he received an Academy Award nomination. His
                                work on that film was defined by a painterly, classical style that deliberately evoked
                                the religious art of Caravaggio, with its dramatic use of chiaroscuro (strong contrast
                                between light and dark). This approach gave the film its iconic, reverent, yet visceral
                                aesthetic. <strong>Argument For:</strong> Hiring Deschanel would provide direct visual
                                continuity with the first film, grounding the sequel in the same artistic language. He
                                has a proven, Oscar-nominated track record with Gibson on this specific subject matter.
                                <strong>Argument Against:</strong> The sequel's described "acid trip" and metaphysical
                                scope may demand a different, perhaps more modern or surreal, visual style than the
                                classical approach Deschanel is known for.
                            </li>

                            <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>The Visceral Choice - Dean Semler:</strong> Semler
                                has a long and successful history with Gibson, shooting the kinetic, immersive visuals
                                for both <em><strong>Apocalypto</strong></em> and <em><strong>We Were
                                        Soldiers</strong></em>. Semler is a master of natural light and dynamic, often
                                handheld, camerawork that places the audience directly within the action.
                                <strong>Argument For:</strong> If Gibson wants the scenes in Hell and "other realms" to
                                feel chaotic, raw, and terrifyingly real, Semler's visceral style is a perfect match.
                                His work on <em>Apocalypto</em> demonstrates an ability to create a beautiful yet brutal
                                world that feels both epic and immediate. <strong>Argument Against:</strong> His style
                                may be too raw for the more theological and spiritual elements of the story, potentially
                                clashing with the need for moments of awe and transcendence.
                            </li>

                            <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>The Modern Epic Choice - Simon Duggan:</strong>
                                Duggan shot Gibson's most recent major directorial effort, <em><strong>Hacksaw
                                        Ridge</strong></em>, earning an Oscar nomination for his work. Duggan's style
                                blends modern cinematic techniques—including gritty, realistic textures and
                                sophisticated camera movement—with a grand, epic scope. He masterfully handled the chaos
                                of the battle sequences while retaining emotional clarity and a sense of awe.
                                <strong>Argument For:</strong> Duggan represents a bridge between the classical and the
                                visceral. He could bring a contemporary, blockbuster feel to the project that might
                                appeal to a broader audience, handling both the intimate character moments and the
                                grand, supernatural battles with equal skill. <strong>Argument Against:</strong> His
                                modern aesthetic might be seen as a departure from the timeless, painterly quality that
                                defined the first film.
                            </li>

                            <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>The New Blood - Johnny Derango:</strong> Derango is
                                the cinematographer on Gibson's upcoming thriller, <em><strong>Flight
                                        Risk</strong></em>. While he is less established than the other candidates, this
                                represents Gibson's most recent collaborative relationship. Their process on that film
                                can be seen in a detailed behind-the-scenes interview [9]. <strong>Argument
                                    For:</strong> Directors often find a rhythm with new collaborators. If Gibson and
                                Derango established a strong creative shorthand on <em>Flight Risk</em>, Gibson might be
                                inclined to carry that momentum into his passion project. This would be an unexpected
                                but not illogical choice. <strong>Argument Against:</strong> Derango lacks the extensive
                                experience in large-scale historical or VFX-heavy epics that the other candidates
                                possess.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>VFX Supervisor & Lead VFX Vendor:</strong> <strong>There is no announced Visual Effects
                    Supervisor or primary VFX company.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>How We Will Know:</strong> Similar to the cinematographer, this will be a formal
                        announcement in industry trades. The announcement may name both an individual VFX Supervisor and
                        the lead company (e.g., WetaFX, ILM) tasked with the project's extensive effects, particularly
                        the de-aging of Jim Caviezel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reasoned Speculation:</strong> The de-aging work is highly specialized. The contract
                        will likely go to one of the industry leaders in this field, such as <strong>Lola VFX</strong>
                        (known for their work on Marvel films), <strong>WetaFX</strong>, or <strong>Industrial Light &
                            Magic (ILM)</strong>. The choice will depend heavily on methodology, cost, and the vendor's
                        existing relationship with Lionsgate.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Official Production Greenlight & Budget:</strong> Lionsgate has not made a formal announcement
                that the film has been officially greenlit for production, nor has a budget been disclosed.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>How We Will Know:</strong> The official greenlight will be confirmed when Lionsgate
                        includes a specific capital commitment for the project in its <strong>quarterly (10-Q) or annual
                            (10-K) filings</strong> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission [10]. This is the
                        most definitive financial confirmation possible.</li>
                </ul>

        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: #f1f5f9; margin-top: 30px;">IV. Definitive Next Steps for Investigation</h3>

            production will be marked by several key, verifiable milestones. Moving beyond rumor and speculation, these
            are the specific announcements and official filings to monitor for definitive proof that cameras are
            preparing to roll.</p>
